# ser2bt-bridge
## Serial to Bluetooth bridge for raspberry pi zero

### Introduction:
This is a set of scripts, that allow a user to connect to a raspberry pi zero wh to a serial device (cisco switch), then allow the user to connect to it via serial over bluetooth, and then the pi will bridge the two connections to form a single console from the users pc to the switch without having wires laying on the floor.

This is probably better to use this than ser2net as a lot of environments will not allow multiple metwork connections to a given device at the same time, so a given laptop could connect to the pi via ip, but would loose access to corperate/govornemt resources while they work.

Bluetooth over serial is better as allows a given laptop with these restrictions to still connect to the switches console port while still being connected to the corperate/govornemt resources without violating any rules - or voilating fewer rules... :)

## Installation:
### Base:
The following steps will guide you through the process getting this system to work from just after everything is unboxed, to the point where this works in its base form - that is the raspberry pi zero, by itslef acting as a bluetooth to serial bridge.  We will be using headless installation method, so you will not need a keyboard, mouse, or monitor.
#### Pre-requasites:
In order to get the service to work, without any of the two options: UPS backup, or status screen, you will need:  
- raspberry pi zero w, or if you want to expand without having to solder, raspberry pi zero wh.
- an SD card with a minimum of 8G.  Actually, you can get smaller, but for the price, 8G or 16G is a good choice.
- a USB micro to USB type A for power.
- a USB micro to USB type A Female to connect to a type A to RF45 serial cable to connect to a cisco rj45 console port.
- a USB mini to USB micro to connect to most cisco switch usb console ports.
- A case for said raspberry pi.
#### OS installation and setup:
- insert the SD card into your computer to perform the fist few steps:
  - Download link is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/).
  - Follow Raspbianâ€™s directions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
- Eject and re-insert the SD card, and use your PC's file explorer to open the SD card - should be called boot.
  - Add the following to the end of the first line in /boot/cmdline.txt:
    - modules-load=dwc2,g_serial
  - Save and close cmdline.txt
- Save and close /boot/cmdline.txt
- Add or uncomment the following settings in the /boot/config.txt file:  
  - enable_uart=1
  - dtoverlay=dwc2
- Save and close /boot/config.txt
- Create an empty file and call it ssh - no extensions, just ssh.
- Create another file called wpa_supplicant.conf, and open it:
  - Insert the following:
  ```bash
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1
  country=US
  
  network={
      ssid="SSID"
      psk="passphrase/password"
      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  }

You are now done with this section, safely eject the SD card, and insert it into you raspberry pi zero
- Update OS:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y

- Setup using raspi-config.
  - Setup locals.
  - Set timezone on the Pi.
  - Keyboard (optional).
  - Set gpu memory to 16.
  - Enable SSH.
  - Enable serial
  - Change hostname.
  - Change default password.
  - Setup wireless network.

 
#### So in its base configuration, one only needs the following files:
- bashrc_addendom - to add launch the ser2bt_bridge utility once a user logs using rfcomm (serial over bluetooth.
- rfcomm.service - Launches a service that will listed for incomming connection requests from the rfcomm vty port.
- ser2bt_bridge script - checks to make sure there is a valid connection on rfcomm and either the vtyusb or vtyamc0, and attempts to bridge them together.

#### You also need a:
- micro usb to usb A female cable to connect to a usb to serial cable.
- Micro usb to usb A male to connect from the switch to the Raspberry Pi's power port.
- Some cheap case to house the pi.

### Options - to add a little polish to the bridge:
- For battary backup, attatcg a upslite.
- For status and helth updates, attatch a waveshare.2.13 e-paper display.
- Add additional scripts to monitor the battery's capacity, and to drive the waveshare display.
